## Problem

When a request (e.g., to the `technical-writer` or `code-analyst` agent) produces a plan that fails JSON validation, the raw LLM output was occasionally not saved in the `Rejected/` folder, showing "No raw content available" instead. This occurred primarily when the agent's output was so malformed that XML tag extraction (e.g., missing `<content>` tags) failed, resulting in empty content being passed to the validator.

## Resolution

The issue was resolved through a two-stage approach: a immediate bug fix for log preservation and a long-term fix for universal format enforcement.

### 1. Robust Error Preservation (Bug Fix)

Ensured the full raw LLM response is preserved even if structured parsing fails:

- **Error Enrichment**: Updated `PlanWriter.formatPlan` to catch `PlanValidationError` and enrich its `details` with `fullRawResponse` containing the original `result.raw` from the agent.
- **Fallback Logic**: Updated `RequestProcessor.handleError` to use `fullRawResponse` as a fallback when `rawContent` (extracted from `<content>` tags) is empty or missing.

### 2. Universal Format Enforcement (Proactive Fix)

Implemented more robust enforcement to reduce the occurrence of validation failures:

- **Self-Correction Loop**: Implemented a 2-retry mechanism in `RequestProcessor` that catches `PlanValidationError` and provides specific feedback to the agent for immediate repair.
- **Dynamic Schema Injection**: `AgentRunner` now dynamically injects machine-readable JSON schema instructions (generated via `SchemaDescriber`) into all agent prompts.
- **Automated JSON Repair**: Integrated `json-repair` into `PlanAdapter` to automatically fix common LLM syntax errors (trailing commas, unquoted keys).
- **Blueprint Standardization**: Fixed malformed XML tags (`</content>`) in `technical-writer.md` and `software-architect.md`.

## Verification

### Automated Tests

Successfull verification with a dedicated reproduction test and existing regression tests:

- `tests/plan_validation_repro_issue_003_test.ts` (manually run and then removed) verified that malformed XML output still results in a rejected plan file containing the full raw response.
- `tests/request_processor_plan_validation_error_test.ts` passed 4/4 tests.

```bash
ok | 4 passed | 0 failed (119ms)
```
