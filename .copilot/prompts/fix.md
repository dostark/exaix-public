Key points
- Identify root cause from bug report or test failure
- Write regression test first to prevent recurrence
- Fix the issue minimally, then validate all tests pass
- Ensure linting clean and document the fix

Canonical prompt (short):
"Fix this bug/failing test. Identify root cause, write regression test, implement fix, validate all tests pass and code is clean."

Examples
- Example prompt: "Fix the PathResolver symlink handling bug that's failing tests."
- Example prompt: "The login validation is throwing errors for valid inputs."

Do / Don't
- ✅ Do write regression test before fixing
- ✅ Do identify and fix root cause
- ✅ Do run all affected tests
- ✅ Do ensure linting and formatting clean
- ❌ Don't fix without regression test
- ❌ Don't return until all tests pass
- ❌ Don't skip documentation
