## Prompt Template

```text
Add new content to docs/Building_with_AI_Agents.md documenting recent work.

Requirements:

1. Follow proper Part numbering (next available: Part [X])

1.
1.
1.

Content structure:

- Part title with thematic name (e.g., "The Self-Documenting Agent System")
- Personal narrative opening (the problem, the wake-up call)
- Technical details with code examples
- Before/After comparisons
- Pattern recognition
- Meta-insights and philosophical wins

Update context:

- Last updated: [git log --oneline --all -- docs/Building_with_AI_Agents.md | head -1]
- Commits since then: [git log LAST_HASH..HEAD --oneline]
- Focus areas: [agents/ enhancements / CI/CD / testing / etc.]

After writing:

1. Rebuild agents infrastructure (build_agents_index.ts, build_agents_embeddings.ts, validate)

1.
```

## Example Usage

**User:**

```text
Add new content to docs/Building_with_AI_Agents.md documenting recent work.

Requirements:

1. Follow proper Part numbering (next available: Part XVII)

1.
1.
1.

Content structure:

- Part title: "The Self-Documenting Agent System (January 2026)"
- Opening: The bootstrap problem (not using agents/ to enhance agents/)
- Technical details: Step 10.5 enhancements (claude.md, claude-rag.md, prompts/, cross-reference.md)
- Before/After: No templates → 8 copy-paste ready prompts
- Patterns: Documentation as a product, dual-interface system
- Meta-insight: Using agents/ to improve agents/ (the irony)

Update context:

- Last updated: b849adf (feat(ci): implement unified CI pipeline...)
- Commits since: 8cea321..HEAD (9 commits covering agents/ enhancements and CI/CD)
- Focus areas: agents/ prompts, RAG workflow, git hooks, multi-platform builds

After writing:

1. Rebuild agents infrastructure

   - RAG Context Injection
   - Inspect Embeddings
   - Agent Prompts Library
   - Git Hooks Setup
   - Local CI Gate
1.
   - For Agent Documentation Updates
   - For RAG Context Injection
   - For CI/CD and Quality Gates
   - For Commit Messages
```

**Expected Response:**

Claude should:

1. **Research phase**:

```bash
# Find last update
git log --oneline --all -- docs/Building_with_AI_Agents.md | head -1

# Get commits since then
git log b849adf..HEAD --oneline

# Read detailed commit messages
git log b849adf..HEAD --format="%H" | while read hash; do git show --stat $hash; done
```

1. **Content analysis**:
   - Review chat history for user's prompts and agent's responses
   - Identify patterns (e.g., "not following agents/ folder instructions")
   - Extract "wake-up call" moments (e.g., being called out for inconsistency)
   - Note technical implementations (prompt templates, RAG guide, git hooks)

   ## Part XVII: The Self-Documenting Agent System (January 2026)

   ### The Bootstrap Problem Revisited

   Remember Part IX where we created the `agents/` directory? We had documentation
   _for_ agents, but we were still treating it like regular docs—write it, forget it,
   hope the AI reads it someday.

   **The Wake-Up Call**:

   \```
   Me: [implements Step 10.5 enhancements to agents/ folder]
   Me: [finishes implementation]
   Me: [about to commit]
   You: "You did not follow instructions in agents/ folder. Why?"
   Me: ... 😳
   \```

   I had just enhanced the agents/ system to make it MORE useful... without using
   the agents/ system to guide that enhancement. Peak irony.

   [... continues with technical details, examples, before/after, patterns ...]
   ````

1.
   - Add rows to Essential Patterns table
   - Add new question templates
   - Maintain formatting consistency

1.

   ```bash
   deno run --allow-read --allow-write scripts/build_agents_index.ts
   deno run --allow-read --allow-write scripts/build_agents_embeddings.ts --mode mock
   deno run --allow-read scripts/validate_agents_docs.ts
   ```

## Style Guidelines

### ✅ Do

**Personal and Entertaining**:

```markdown
**The Wake-Up Call**:
I had just enhanced the agents/ system to make it MORE useful... without using
the agents/ system to guide that enhancement. Peak irony.
```

**Before/After with Concrete Examples**:

```markdown
**Before Step 10.5**:

- Agent docs existed but were hard to discover
- No clear workflow for using RAG
- Inconsistent prompting patterns

**After Step 10.5**:

- 19 agent docs (up from 11)
- 8 copy-paste prompt templates
- Cross-reference map for navigation

## Technical Details with Code**

**The Rebuild Workflow**:

```bash
# After any agents/ changes:
deno run --allow-read --allow-write scripts/build_agents_index.ts
deno run --allow-read --allow-write scripts/build_agents_embeddings.ts --mode mock
deno run --allow-read scripts/validate_agents_docs.ts
```

**Meta-Insights**:

```markdown
### The Meta-Learning: Documentation Is a Product

Treating documentation like code revolutionized quality:

- Schema validation (YAML frontmatter with Zod)
- Automated testing (12 tests for content structure)
- CI gates (can't merge broken docs)

### ❌ Don't

**Dry, Technical Documentation Style**:

```markdown
## agents/ Folder Enhancements

The agents/ folder was updated with the following improvements:

- Added claude.md version 0.2
- Created claude-rag.md with RAG workflow
- Added 8 prompt templates

**Missing Context or "Why"**:

```markdown
We added prompt templates to agents/prompts/. These include TDD workflow,
refactoring, and debugging templates.
```

(Missing: Why were these needed? What problem did they solve? What was the wake-up call?)

**No Before/After Comparison**:

```markdown
The agents/ system now has cross-reference navigation.
```

(Missing: What was the pain before? How much better is it after? Concrete metrics?)

**Generic Advice**:

```markdown
Good documentation is important for project success.
```

(Missing: ExoFrame-specific examples, personal stories, actual impact)

## Key Patterns to Capture

When updating Building_with_AI_Agents.md, look for these patterns in recent work:

1. **Ironic Moments**: System designed to solve X fails at X (e.g., not using agents/ to improve agents/)

## Integration with Other Prompts

This prompt often follows:

- **implementation-plan-driven.md** — After completing a major Implementation Plan step
- **commit-message.md** — After creating detailed commits with rich context
- **refactoring-with-thinking.md** — After complex multi-step refactoring work

This prompt often precedes:

- **commit-message.md** — Commit the documentation update itself
- **rag-context-injection.md** — Use updated docs for future context injection

## Success Criteria

A good Building_with_AI_Agents.md update includes:

- ✅ Proper Part numbering (sequential, no gaps)
- ✅ Entertaining narrative style (personal, humorous, insightful)
- ✅ Technical accuracy (correct commands, file paths, test counts)
- ✅ Before/After comparisons (with metrics)
- ✅ Code examples (bash commands, file snippets, prompts)
- ✅ Pattern recognition (what's reusable beyond this specific case)
- ✅ Meta-insights (philosophical wins about AI-human collaboration)
- ✅ Updated reference sections (Essential Patterns, Question Templates)
- ✅ Rebuilt agents infrastructure (manifest, chunks, embeddings validated)
- ✅ Links to actual files (using relative paths like `../agents/prompts/`)
