Welcome to the ExoFrame prompt template library for coding agents. This collection enables agents to systematically wrap raw user prompts with advanced, context-rich instructions, ensuring clarity, completeness, and best practices for all coding tasks in the ExoFrame codebase.

## How It Works

- **Template Selection:** For each raw user prompt, the agent selects the most suitable template (see aliases below).
- **Prompt Embedding:** The agent embeds the raw prompt into the body of the chosen template, following all instructions and requirements.
- **Best Practices:** Each template enforces ExoFrame standards: TDD, regression tests, linting, success criteria, and more.
- **Aliases:** Use the alias (e.g. `#plan`, `@fix`, `#step`) in your prompt to suggest a template, or let the agent auto-select.

## Why Use Templates?

- **Consistency:** Ensures all requests are clear, systematic, and actionable.
- **Completeness:** Reminds agents to include tests, criteria, and validation steps.
- **Professionalism:** Moves from amateur prompting to advanced, reliable agent workflows.

## Template Aliases

- `#plan` — Feature Planning
- `#step` — Implement Feature Step
- `#fix` — Bug/Test Fix
- `#refactor` — Refactoring
- `#doc` — Documentation
- `#review` — Code Review
- `#test` — Test Creation
- `#infra` — Infrastructure/Config
- `#regression` — Regression Test
- `#lint` — Linting/Formatting
- `#security` — Security Patch
- `#upgrade` — Dependency/Version Upgrade
- `#explore` — Codebase Exploration
- `#duplication` — Code Duplication Reduction
- `#next-steps` — TDD Red-Green-Refactor Phase Steps (plan-driven, CI-gated, per-step commits)

## Usage Example

> "#plan Add OAuth2 login support"

The agent will wrap your raw prompt with the `plan` template, ensuring all planning best practices are followed.

---

**Agents:** Always use these templates to maximize success and reliability. If the user prompt lacks details, fill gaps using ExoFrame standards and your own expertise.

## Agent Prompt Examples

This folder contains example prompts demonstrating how to effectively utilize the `agents/` documentation system with Claude and OpenAI agents.

## How to Use These Prompts

### 1. Choose the Right Template

Match your task to the appropriate prompt template:

| Your Task                          | Use This Template                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add a new feature with tests       | [tdd-workflow.md](tdd-workflow.md)                                     |
| Extract common code to helper      | [refactoring-with-thinking.md](refactoring-with-thinking.md)           |
| Fix a failing test                 | [debugging-systematic.md](debugging-systematic.md)                     |
| Work on Implementation Plan step   | [implementation-plan-driven.md](implementation-plan-driven.md)         |
| Create a commit message            | [commit-message.md](commit-message.md)                                 |
| Update Building with AI Agents doc | [update-building-with-ai-agents.md](update-building-with-ai-agents.md) |

| Reduce code duplication            | [duplication.md](duplication.md)                                       |
| Need docs for unfamiliar area      | [rag-context-injection.md](rag-context-injection.md)                   |
| OpenAI quickstart (diff-first)     | [openai-quickstart.md](openai-quickstart.md)                           |
| OpenAI context injection           | [openai-rag-context-injection.md](openai-rag-context-injection.md)     |
| OpenAI TDD workflow                | [openai-tdd-workflow.md](openai-tdd-workflow.md)                       |
| OpenAI debugging workflow          | [openai-debugging-systematic.md](openai-debugging-systematic.md)       |
| Gemini quickstart (long-context)   | [google-quickstart.md](google-quickstart.md)                           |
| Gemini TDD workflow (exhaustive)   | [google-tdd-workflow.md](google-tdd-workflow.md)                       |

### 2. Customize the Template

Replace placeholders with your specific details:

- `[component name]` → actual component (e.g., "PathResolver", "EventLogger")
- `[description]` → your specific issue or feature
- `[query]` → search terms relevant to your task
- `[2-10]` → chunk limit based on complexity (simple: 2-3, medium: 4-6, complex: 8-10)

### 3. Copy-Paste and Send

Each template has an "Example Usage" section showing complete, ready-to-use prompts. You can:

1. Copy the example prompt

1.
1.

### 4. Iterate as Needed

For multi-step tasks:

- Use one prompt per major step
- Re-inject context between steps if the focus changes
- Reference the Implementation Plan to track progress

## Token Budget Guidelines

**How many chunks to inject:**

| Task Complexity     | Chunks       | Example                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple lookup       | 2-3          | "How do I clean up database connections?"           |
| Standard feature    | 4-6          | "Add input validation for Portal config"            |
| Complex feature     | 8-10         | "Design security test suite for Portal boundaries"  |
| Multi-step workflow | 3-5 per step | "Step 1: Design → Step 2: Test → Step 3: Implement" |

**Note:** Claude has 200k context window, but targeted context is more effective than dumping all docs.

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do

- **Start with cross-reference** if you're unsure which docs apply
- **Inject fresh context** for each major step in multi-step tasks
- **Use thinking protocol** for complex changes requiring planning
- **Reference Implementation Plan** for all significant work
- **Follow TDD** for code changes (test first, then implement)
- **Verify success criteria** before marking steps complete

### ❌ Don't

- Don't skip context injection for complex tasks
- Don't inject 10+ chunks for simple questions (wastes tokens)
- Don't proceed without reading Implementation Plan first
- Don't forget to rebuild chunks/embeddings after doc changes:

  ```bash
  deno run --allow-read --allow-write scripts/build_agents_index.ts
  deno run --allow-read --allow-write scripts/build_agents_embeddings.ts --mode mock
  ```

- Don't implement features without corresponding Plan step

## Combining Prompts

For comprehensive workflows, combine multiple templates:

```markdown
PHASE 1: Discovery
Use: cross-reference-navigation.md to find relevant docs

PHASE 2: Planning
Use: implementation-plan-driven.md to read/create Plan step

PHASE 3: Context Injection
Use: rag-context-injection.md to gather relevant patterns

PHASE 4: Implementation
Use: tdd-workflow.md to implement with tests

PHASE 5: Verification
Use: implementation-plan-driven.md to verify and mark complete
```

## Examples by Use Case

### "I want to add a completely new feature"

1. **Start:** [implementation-plan-driven.md](implementation-plan-driven.md) — Find or create Plan step

1.
1.

### "I have a bug I can't figure out"

1. **Start:** [debugging-systematic.md](debugging-systematic.md) — Systematic diagnosis

1.

### "I need to refactor a complex pattern across multiple files"

1. **Start:** [cross-reference-navigation.md](cross-reference-navigation.md) — Find refactoring docs

1.
1.

## Updating These Prompts

When you discover better patterns:

1. Create new prompt file or update existing one

1.
1.

   ```bash
   deno run --allow-read --allow-write scripts/build_agents_index.ts
   deno run --allow-read --allow-write scripts/build_agents_embeddings.ts --mode mock
   deno run --allow-read scripts/validate_agents_docs.ts
   ```

## Meta Note

These prompts ARE the agents/ documentation system in action. They demonstrate:

- How to query the system (RAG)
- How to structure requests (thinking protocol)
- How to follow workflows (cross-reference)
- How to maintain consistency (Implementation Plan)

The prompts themselves follow the patterns they teach. Use them as templates, adapt them to your needs, and contribute improvements back to this folder.
