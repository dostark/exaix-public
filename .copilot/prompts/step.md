```text
Key points
- Restate step context from feature plan
- Write/update tests first (TDD approach)
- Implement minimal code to pass tests
- Ensure linting clean and success criteria met
- Document decisions and validate before returning

Canonical prompt (short):
"Implement this specific step from the feature plan. Write tests first, implement minimally, validate all criteria, then document."

Examples
- Example prompt: "Implement Step 3.2: Add user authentication validation."
- Example prompt: "Complete the database schema migration step with tests."

Do / Don't
- ✅ Do write tests before implementation
- ✅ Do verify all planned tests pass
- ✅ Do ensure linting and formatting clean
- ✅ Do meet all success criteria
- ❌ Don't implement without tests
- ❌ Don't return until validation complete
- ❌ Don't skip documentation

- Linting clean
- Success criteria met

**Notes:**

- Add regression test if fixing a bug.
- Document any edge cases handled.
