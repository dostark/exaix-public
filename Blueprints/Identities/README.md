# Identity Blueprints

This directory contains identity blueprint templates that define LLM personas, models, and capabilities for Exaix.

## Directory Structure

- `examples/`: **Reference Implementations**. Comprehensive, ready-to-use identity blueprints (e.g., `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`). Use these to learn best practices or as a base for custom identities.
- `templates/`: **Abstract Patterns**. Reusable templates (e.g., `pipeline-agent`, `collaborative-agent`) with placeholders. Use these when you need a specific behavioral pattern but want to define the persona from scratch.
- `*.md`: **Active Identities**. Identity blueprints available for immediate use in your workspace (e.g., `default.md`, `senior-coder.md`).

## Skills Integration (Phase 17)

All identities support `default_skills` for automatic procedural knowledge injection:

`````yaml
---
agent_id: "my-identity"
name: "My Identity"
model: "google:gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
capabilities: ["read_file", "write_file"]
default_skills: ["code-review", "error-handling", "portal-grounding"]  # NEW
---
```text

**Available Core Skills:** `code-review`, `security-first`, `tdd-methodology`, `error-handling`, `documentation-driven`, `typescript-patterns`, `commit-message`, `exaix-conventions`

See `Blueprints/Skills/` for skill definitions.

## Usage Guide

### Using Active Identities

Active identities are ready to use:

```bash
exactl request "Task description" --identity senior-coder
```text

### Using Examples

Examples in `examples/` are for learning. To use one:

1. Copy it to this directory: `cp examples/code-reviewer.md .`

1.

### Using Templates

Templates in `templates/` are for creating new identities:

1. Copy a template: `cp templates/pipeline-agent.md.template my-identity.md`

1.
1.

Each identity blueprint file contains:

1. **YAML Frontmatter** (between `---` delimiters)
   - agent_id, name, model, capabilities, default_skills, etc.

1.
   - Identity persona and capabilities
   - **JSON Plan Schema** with examples
   - Response format instructions

## Available Tools

The following tools are available for identities to use in their plans:

| Tool               | Description                        | Why/When to Use                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `read_file`        | Read the contents of a file        | Use to examine the full content of a specific file.                                                |
| `write_file`       | Create or overwrite a file         | Use for creating new files or rewriting small files. **Avoid** for large files (use `patch_file`). |
| `run_command`      | Execute a shell command            | Use for system commands not covered by specialized tools (e.g., `npm install`).                    |
| `list_directory`   | List files and directories         | Use to explore file structure and discover file names in a folder.                                 |
| `search_files`     | Search for files by name           | Use when you know the filename (or wildcard) but not its location.                                 |
| `create_directory` | Create a new directory             | Use before creating files in non-existent nested paths.                                            |
| `fetch_url`        | Fetch content from an external URL | Use to read external documentation or schemas (if domain is whitelisted).                          |
| `grep_search`      | Search file contents using regex   | Use to find code definitions, references, or text patterns across the codebase.                    |
| `git_info`         | Get repository status/diffs        | Use to see what changed, check current branch, or find untracked files.                            |
| `move_file`        | Move or rename a file              | Use for refactoring to ensure atomic moves and path validation.                                    |
| `copy_file`        | Copy a file                        | Use to duplicate files, such as creating a backup before editing.                                  |
| `delete_file`      | Delete a file                      | Use to permanently remove unused or temporary files.                                               |
| `deno_task`        | Run standard Deno tasks            | Use `test`, `lint`, or `fmt` to verify code quality and adherence to standards.                    |
| `patch_file`       | Apply precision text edits         | Use for making targeted changes to **large** files to save tokens and reduce risk.                 |

## Creating New Identities

Use `exactl blueprint identity create` or manually create following this template:

````markdown
+++
agent_id = "my-identity"
name = "My Custom Identity"
model = "provider:model-name"
capabilities = ["capability1", "capability2"]
created = "2025-12-09T00:00:00Z"
created_by = "your-email@example.com"
version = "1.0.0"
+++

# Identity Name

Identity description and persona...

## Shared fragments (new)

To reduce code duplication in identities, use the `{{include:fragment_name}}` syntax. This will inject the contents of `Blueprints/Fragments/fragment_name.md` into the identity's system prompt during loading.

### Example Usage:

```markdown
## Response Format

{{include:standard-response-format}}

### Plan JSON Schema

{{include:plan-schema-full}}
```text
````text

### Key Fragments:

- `standard-response-format`: Unified instructions for `<thought>` and `<content>` tags.
- `plan-schema-full`: The complete, authoritative JSON schema for executable plans.
- `blueprint-best-practices`: Tips for prompt engineering and plan quality.

Fragments are resolved recursively, allowing fragments to include other fragments.

````text
## Validation

The system will:

1. Extract JSON from `<content>` tags

1.
1.

## Testing

Test your identity with:

```bash
exactl request "Your test request" --identity my-identity
```text

Check the generated plan in `Workspace/Plans/` - it should contain properly formatted markdown converted from JSON.
`````
