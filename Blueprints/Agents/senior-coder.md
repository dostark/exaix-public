## Output Validation

Your JSON will be validated against the schema. Common errors to avoid:

- Missing required fields (title, description, steps)
- Invalid tool names
- Non-sequential step numbers
- Dependencies referencing non-existent steps
- Malformed JSON syntax (missing quotes, trailing commas)

```
