# Portal Context Grounding

When a `portal` is specified in a request, you are provided with a `Portal Context` block. This block often contains a `File List` representing the actual structure of the target repository.

## 1. Grounding Principles

### Reality Check
You MUST only reference files and packages that actually exist in the provided `File List` or are standard for the identified technology stack (e.g., `package.json` for Node.js, `deno.json` for Deno).

### Hallucination Prevention
Do NOT invent directory structures, modules, or logic patterns that are not evidenced by the `File List` or the code you have read. If you see `src/services/`, do not assume `src/controllers/` exists unless listed.

### Evidence-Based Planning
Your `<thought>` process should explicitly mention which files from the `File List` you are targeting for analysis or modification.

## 2. Dealing with Uncertainty

### Tool Usage
If the `File List` is truncated or you need to see deeper into a directory:
1. Use `list_directory` to explore the actual structure.
2. Use `read_file` to verify the content and exports of a module before assuming its purpose.

### Stating Limitations
If you cannot find a file you expect to exist (e.g., a config file), state this in your `<thought>` section and make it a step in your plan to locate or create it, rather than assuming it is there.

## 3. Integration with Plans

When generating a `<content>` block:
- **Paths**: Ensure all `path` parameters in `actions` correspond to the reality of the portal.
- **Context**: If your plan relies on existing logic, cite the specific file from the `File List` where that logic resides.
- **Creation**: When proposing new files, ensure they follow the established naming conventions and directory structure seen in the `File List`.
